# Milk

Milk is text adventure game that goes outside the realm of a typical narrative by taking inspiration from interesting and unconventional plotlines from stories like 'Jojo's Bizarre Adventure' (JJBA) and plot-twist heavy games such as '9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors' (999) and Ace Attorney. As well as being an inspiration for the story, we are also taking aesthetic inspiration from these series. JJBA in particular features a unique art style that has a more gritty, detailed look that we'd like to incorporate into our game. Because we would like our game to be more fantastical in content, we would also like the art to reflect this, thus giving a more immersive, enjoyable experience to the player. We'd like to incorporate puzzle aspects similar to that of 999 wherein the goal is to "find a way out" by examining the environment, and player choices like those present in the game 'Reigns'.
